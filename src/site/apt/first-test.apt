Your First Test

  NOTE: This is a first draft and it's still incomplete.
  Please send feedback to atgdust-general@lists.sourceforge.net.

  This tutorial walks you through the steps of writing a test which does not need to run
  in an application server. This is one of the main benefis of writing unit tests. Because 
  the test does not depend upon starting up an application server, turnaround time is very quick.
  Tests can be started and finished in just a matter of seconds (or less).

  I'm assuming that the reader is familiar with quite a few things here.
  These things are:

 * ATG  -- Art Technology Group, eCommerce software vendor http://www.atg.com/

 * JUnit -- A Unit testing framework for Java

 * Maven -- An apache project, this is a build system.

 * Subversion -- A source control system
  

* Getting the source code

  There are no builds yet of dust, so in this example we will checkout and compile the 
  dust test classes. Source code is stored in a subversion repository, and the project is built with
  Maven 2. You'll need to download and install subversion and maven 2 before continuing.


+------------------------------------------+
svn checkout https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/atgdust/trunk atgdust
+------------------------------------------+


* Pointing Maven at ATG classes

  The DUST project uses Maven to compile its classes and run tests.
  Located in the pom.xml file of this project there are two dependencies on
  ATG classes. One is on ${DYNAMO_ROOT}/DAS/lib/classes.jar the other is on ${DYNAMO_ROOT}/DAS/lib/resources.jar.

  Because these libraries are not available on a public maven repository, you'll need to import
  them into your maven repository. Fortunatly, Maven has a command to do just this.

  Here's an example assuming you are on Windows and your ATG installation is C:\ATG\ATG2006.3.
  The forward slashes below are on purpose.

  First the DAS/lib/classes.jar

+------------------------------------------+
mvn deploy:deploy-file -DgroupId=atg -DartifactId=DAS -Dversion=2006.3 -Dpackaging=jar 
-Dfile=c:/ATG/ATG2006.3/DAS/lib/classes.jar -DgeneratePom=true -Durl=file://c:/maven/repository -DlocalRepository=local
+------------------------------------------+


  Then DAS/lib/resources.jar

+------------------------------------------+
mvn deploy:deploy-file -DgroupId=atg -DartifactId=DAS-resources -Dversion=2006.3 -Dpackaging=jar
-Dfile=c:/ATG/ATG2006.3/DAS/lib/resources.jar -DgeneratePom=true -Durl=file://c:/maven/repository -DlocalRepository=local
+------------------------------------------+


* Building the Source

  Once you have checked out the project and installed maven, build the source code.
  We'll use the 'mvn install' command to do that.

+------------------------------------------+
% cd atgdust
% mvn install
+------------------------------------------+


  Note that you now have a src/target directory under your 'atgdust' directory.
  In here is a jar file containg all the classes of the dust project. 

  To make this example simpler we'll instead just write a test in the src/test directory of this project.


* Writing a Test

  Change directory to the 'src/test' directory. Then make a new directory called 'test'. 
  This will be the package name of our test.

+------------------------------------------+
% cd atgdust/src/test
% mkdir test
+------------------------------------------+

  The goal of this test is to test a class that depends upon a running Nucleus.
  Our class being tested contains code that calls Nucleus.resolveName() so we'll
  need a Nucleus available to allow our class to be tested in JUnit.

** Class to be Tested

  Let's take a look at the class we would like to test. This class is a typical Nucleus component.
  It extends the base class atg.nucleus.GenericService and implements the doStartService() and doStopService()
  methods. If our class starts up correctly it will set the mCleanStart member variable to true. Otherwise,
  doStartService() will throw an exception and mCleanStart will remain false. Shutting down this service should
  result in mCleanStart being reset to false again.


+------------------------------------------+
package com.mycompany;

import atg.nucleus.GenericService;
import atg.nucleus.Nucleus;
import atg.nucleus.ServiceException;
import atg.nucleus.logging.ApplicationLogging;

/**
 * This is an example class created for the purpose
 * of demonstrating how to write test code with DUST.
 * 
 * @author adamb
 *
 */
public class ToBeTested extends GenericService {

  boolean mCleanStart = false;
  
  // -------------------------
  /**
   * Called when this component is started.
   */
  public void doStartService() throws ServiceException {
    prepare();
  }
  
  // -------------------------
  /**
   * Called when this component is shut down.
   */
  public void doStopService() throws ServiceException {
    mCleanStart = false;
  }
  
  // -------------------------
  /**
   * Checks that Nucleus is running, if its not, then throw
   * a ServiceException.
   * If Nucleus is running, the log an info message.
   * @throws ServiceException
   */
  public void prepare() throws ServiceException {
    Nucleus n = Nucleus.getGlobalNucleus();
    if (n == null)
      throw new ServiceException("Nucleus is not running.");
    else
      ((ApplicationLogging)n).logInfo("Prepared.");
    mCleanStart = true;
  }
}


+------------------------------------------+



** Creating the Test Class

  Let's create our JUnit test class under the atgdust/src/test/java/test directory. The name of this class should end with "Test".
  Note that this is a JUnit 3.8 convention. JUnit 4 allows the use of java5 annotations to make a class as a test.

  This test class will first create a directory to be used as the configpath for Nucleus.
  In that directory we'll generate one .properties file to be used to start our component being tested.


  Note: We really don't want to point this test at the full configpath of a given ATG project.
  It'll attempt (unsuccessfully) to startup *everything* in the configpath of that project which pretty much defeats
  the purpose of a unit test.

  The atg.nucleus.NucleusTestUtils class is a handy class to deal with starting up Nucleus. 
  In this case , just for fun, we want our test component to start up as soon as Nucleus starts.
  The NucleusTestUtils.createInitial method is used to create an Initial.properties file including the Nucleus
  path of our component.  

  Note how we pass in our generated configpath to the NucleusTestUtils.startNucleus() method.
  Once this method is called, Nucleus will start. 

  Inside the try block we can resolve our test component, check that it's not null and confirm that
  it started cleanly. In the finally block we tell Nucleus to shut down by calling stopService(). 
  After stopService() has been called we confirm that the mCleanStart member variable has been
  set back to false.
  


+------------------------------------------+

package test;

import java.io.File;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Properties;

import junit.framework.TestCase;
import atg.nucleus.Nucleus;
import atg.nucleus.NucleusTestUtils;

import com.mycompany.ToBeTested;

public class FirstTest extends TestCase {
  
  /**
   * Start up a nucleus given a local test "configpath".
   * In that configpath is a .properties file for our TestComponent
   * @throws Exception
   */
  public void testComponentStartup() throws Exception {
    File configpath = NucleusTestUtils.getConfigpath(this.getClass(),"config");
    // Put test .properties file in configpath path
    Properties props = new Properties();
    File propFile = NucleusTestUtils.createProperties("test/TestComponent", configpath, "com.mycompany.ToBeTested", props);
    propFile.deleteOnExit();
    List initial = new ArrayList();
    initial.add("/test/TestComponent");
    NucleusTestUtils.createInitial(configpath, initial);
    Nucleus n = NucleusTestUtils.startNucleus(configpath);
    ToBeTested testComponent = null;
    try {
      testComponent = (ToBeTested) n.resolveName("/test/TestComponent");
      assertNotNull("Could not resolve test componet",testComponent);
      assertTrue("Test component did not start up cleanly.",testComponent.mCleanStart);
      
    } finally {
      n.stopService();
      assertNotNull(testComponent);
      assertFalse("Test component did not shut down cleanly.",testComponent.mCleanStart);
      testComponent = null;
    }
    
  }

}

+------------------------------------------+


* Running the test

  You may run this test either in your favorite IDE or maven. In this example i'll show the output of running the test from maven.
  To start the test simply use the "mvn test" command from your command line. Note that "mvn test" runs all the 
  tests in the "src/test" directory of the DUST projects. There's another test in there called GSATestUtilsTest as well.
  You can ignore the output from that test. But take a look at the source to see how it's implemented!
