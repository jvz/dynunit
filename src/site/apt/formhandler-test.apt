Unit Testing Dynamo FormhHandlers

* Introduction 

  FormHandlers are an often used pattern in ATG. Basically a FormHandler allows one to map an HTML form
  field to a Nucleus component property. Ideally formhandlers really shouldn't have any "business logic" in them and therefore
  the type of testing required on the formhandler should be more about checking if it handles errors, null inputs etc...
  Often though there is much more business logic than that in a formhandler. Beware, existing formahandlers with lots of business logic are going to be tough to unit test and may require some refactoring to be made more easily testable.

* Capabilities

  The formhandler testing features in DUST are basic. Here's what you get:

  *  (ServletTestUtils) A utility class for creating a dummy Dynamo Request/Response pair. Take a look at this article for more info: {{http://atgdust.sourceforge.net/servlet-test.html}}
  * You may write to an input stream, thus simulating a browser request (add headers, etc...)
  * Add request parameters by populating a map
  * Read from the output stream to which your formhandler will be writing.
  * The output stream may also be converted to a String (it's just a ByteBuffer)
 
  After that you are pretty much on your own calling your formhandler methods from JUnit. This article walks you through the process so you aren't totally on your own! 

* Setting up a FormHandler Test

  We are going to use the ServletTestUtils class to create a Dynamo Request/Response pair. These object may then be passed to the formhandlers
  "handle" methods.

  First things first, like other DUST tests you should start by creating a new class that extends AtgDustCase.
  In your setup method, prepare any .properties files that you'll need copied into your test's "configpath".
  Remember, a DUST test will start Nucleus inside of junit and resolve the components you put in your configpath.
  
  Here's a typical setUp() method.

+------------------------------------------+
    @Override
  protected void setUp() throws Exception {
    super.setUp();
    // We can reuse this instance for all tests
    if (mServletTestUtils == null) mServletTestUtils = new ServletTestUtils();
    copyConfigurationFiles(new String[] {
      "src/test/resources/" + this.getClass().getSimpleName() + "/config".replace("/", File.separator)
    }, "target/test-classes/" + this.getClass().getSimpleName() + "/config".replace("/", File.separator),
        ".svn");
  }
+------------------------------------------+

  This method copies configuration files from src/test/resources/<YourTestClassName> to the classpath used for running the test.
  In this case we're using apache maven directory conventions. You'll probably have a different directory convention if you
  are running your test from within Eclipse.

  Note we also create a ServletTestUtils class. That'll be used later on in the test.

* FormHandler Test Method

  Now that the setUp() method is done we can get into the test logic. Here's a very basic example for a formhandler 
  that does nothing but call "sendLocalRedirect()" to a url passed in as a request parameter:

+------------------------------------------+
  public void testSimpleFormHandler() throws Exception {
    SimpleFormHandler simpleFormHandler = (SimpleFormHandler) resolveNucleusComponent("/atg/test/SimpleFormHandler");
    assertNotNull(simpleFormHandler);
    Map<String, String> params = new HashMap<String, String>();
    // Add a request parameter
    String redirectPage = "/success.jsp";
    params.put(SimpleFormHandler.REDIRECT_URL_PARAM_NAME,redirectPage);
    // let's try 128k, should be more than enough
    int bufferSize = 128 * 1024;
    // Setup request/response pair
    TestingDynamoHttpServletRequest request = mServletTestUtils.createDynamoHttpServletRequest(params, bufferSize, "GET");
    TestingDynamoHttpServletResponse response = mServletTestUtils.createDynamoHttpServletResponse(request);
    request.prepareForRead();
    // invoke handleRedirect
    assertFalse(simpleFormHandler.handleRedirect(request,response));    
  }
+------------------------------------------+
  
  Here's what that method is doing. 

  In this test we set the redirect url as a request parameter and invoke the handlerRedirect() method on our test formhandler.

  Note that the redirect url is set by adding a key/value pair to a Map. This map is then passed into the
  createDynamoHttpServletRequest method. Inside that method the map is used to populate request parameters on the DynamoRequest
  object.

  The prepareForRead() method is important. It sets up the streams used in the DynamoResponse object. Just be sure to call it 
  if you are interested in reading from the response output stream.

  Finally, the handleRedirect() method is invoked on the formhandler.

* Summmary
  That was a short and sweet introduction to invoking your formhandler via DUST. Hopefully it'll be enough information to get you started.
  The challenges remaining after this part will most likely be refactoring of existing formhandlers to break unneeded dependencies during testing.

* Feedback

  If you have problems or you create your own generic utilities to make these tests easier to write we'd love to hear about them here atgdust-general@lists.sourceforge.net.
