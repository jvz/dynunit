{"name":"DynUnit","tagline":"Unit testing helpers for ATG Java Enterprise applications","body":"### Welcome to DynUnit\r\nDynUnit started as a fork of [ATG DUST](http://atgdust.sf.net/), a unit testing framework for [ATG Commerce](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/commerce/atg/index.html), the proprietary Java enterprise framework that predates Java EE itself, and its extensive eCommerce framework. The thing about ATG is that it provides a sort of Java EE solution called Dynamo which provides dependency injection, an ORM layer (known as a Repository which can map to RDBMS, LDAP, XML, HTML, and some other formats), and many other layers from a typical Java EE stack. However, only parts of it have been migrated to use the modern EE APIs (e.g., the Repository framework has *not* been updated to be compatible with [JPA](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/persistence-jsp-140049.html)), so existing solutions can only do so much. That is where DynUnit comes in!\r\n\r\n### What is DynUnit?\r\nDynUnit provides several helper utilities for [JUnit](http://junit.org/) tests along with test implementations of several key Dynamo Nucleus components necessary to bootstrap a stand-alone ATG-based application. The goal is to be able to run automated unit tests on your ATG applications without needing a full-blown installation along with a running Java EE application server (JBoss, WebLogic, or WebSphere are the currently supported servers by ATG).\r\n\r\n### Getting DynUnit\r\nDynUnit is currently under heavy development. The old codebase is being refactored and simplified immensely, and new interfaces that mesh well with JUnit 4 are being written. If you wish to preview it or provide help, you can check out the code on GitHub:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/jvz/dynunit.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is also a mirror on Java.net:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone git://java.net/dynunit~git\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, if you prefer to use Subversion:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsvn co https://github.com/jvz/dynunit/trunk dynunit\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Developers\r\nCurrently, there is only one active developer, Matt Sicker (@jvz). ATG DUST had a few main developers including Manny Parasirakis (@mannypp), Adam B ([adamb06](http://sourceforge.net/users/adamb06)), and Robert Hellwig (@rob-ert, [website](http://bsdroot.com/)), although their current whereabouts are unknown. That, or I never knew them!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
